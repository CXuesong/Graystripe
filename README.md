An HTML + TypeScript implemented plain-text adventure game engine.

## Setup for development

To restore local dependencies for development, you need
```bash
npm update -dev
```
Aside from package dependecies, you need also install the following packages globally
```bash
npm install -g typings
```
Then you may need to restore common ts definitions
```bash
typings install -g
```
